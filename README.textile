h2. Ruby Music Collection

This is a collection of music written purely in ruby. Original contributions from jstrait's "wavefile gem":https://github.com/jstrait/wavefile.

bq. ruby <song_name>.rb # generate a wave file of a song

Additional tuning files can be found in the <code>/lib/</code>. Simply require them after the synthesizer like so:

bq.
require './synth.rb'
require './19-edo.rb'

h3. TODO
